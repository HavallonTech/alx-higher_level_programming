0x07. Python - Test-driven development
 Background Context
 Important notice on intranet checks for Python projects
 Starting from today:
 
 Based on the requirements of each task, you should always write the documentation (module(s) + fu    nction(s)) and tests first, before you actually code anything
 The intranet checks for Python projects won’t be released before their first deadline, in order f    or you to focus more on TDD and think about all possible cases
We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge case. B    ut not in the implementation of them!
Don’t trust the user, always think about all possible edge cases
